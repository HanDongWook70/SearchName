This web site will provide you nationality of your name.
This is a one-page web application.
The API used what was provided by https://nationalize.io/.
Some countries do not have ISO information, so it may not be expressed in Korean.
However, if you are a foreign user, you will be able to find the Korean name of the country based on ISO.
Please enjoy the process of searching the nationality of your name!
And if you like the web page, please share it with many people!
This page is being tracked by GA, and if there are many foreign users, I will also make an English website.
Additionally, services such as vanta/typeit were used.
